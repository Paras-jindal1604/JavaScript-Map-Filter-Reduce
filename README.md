# üîÑ JavaScript Array Methods & Callback Functions ‚Äì Explained

This repository serves as a concise yet detailed explanation of some of the most powerful array methods in JavaScript:  
- `forEach`  
- `map`  
- `filter`  
- `reduce`  
- Plus, a foundational look at **callback functions**, which power all of these methods.

Understanding these concepts is essential for writing clean, functional, and modern JavaScript.

## 1. üîÅ forEach

- The `forEach()` method is used to execute a given function once for each element in an array.
- It is **used for side effects**, such as logging or updating external values.
- It **does not return a new array**, and calling `return` inside it doesn't affect the outer scope.
- Common use: iterating through an array to perform an action on each element.

## 2. üß≠ map

- The `map()` method creates a **new array** populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element.
- It is **pure and functional**, meaning the original array remains unchanged.
- Best used when you want to **transform** elements (e.g., convert numbers, extract values, etc.).
- The returned array has the **same length** as the original array.

---

## 3. üßπ filter

- The `filter()` method creates a **new array** with all elements that **pass a given test**.
- It does not mutate the original array.
- Use `filter()` to extract a **subset** of elements based on a condition.
- The resulting array may have **fewer elements** than the original.

---

## 4. üßÆ reduce

- The `reduce()` method executes a **reducer function** on each element and returns a **single accumulated value**.
- It is useful for calculating sums, products, building objects, or any form of accumulation.
- Takes an optional **initial value**, which is essential for predictable results (especially on empty arrays).
- Offers great flexibility but requires a deeper understanding compared to other methods.

---

## 5. üß† Callback Functions

- A **callback function** is a function passed as an argument to another function.
- All the methods above (`forEach`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`) rely on callbacks to decide how to process each array element.
- Callbacks can be **anonymous** or **named**, and they are a core concept in asynchronous and functional JavaScript.
